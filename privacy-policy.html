    <li>Clinical judgment and patient-care decisions remain with licensed professionals and medical leadership.</li>
    <li>Messages and operational reports are administrative communications and are not medical advice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis and Consent</h2>
  <p>Where required, we process data based on consent, legitimate interests, contract necessity, and legal obligations. For voice and message communications, we apply jurisdiction-specific consent and recording controls, including two-party consent restrictions where applicable.</p>

  <p>By opting in to receive text messages from EVE Systems, you agree to receive service and operational messages. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to opt out and <strong>HELP</strong> for support.</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We may share information with service providers and infrastructure partners (for example voice, telephony, cloud hosting, and analytics providers) solely to deliver and secure services. We do not sell personal information for third-party advertising.</p>

  <h2>7. Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain information only as long as needed for operational, legal, security, and contractual purposes, then delete or de-identify it where required.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use technical and organizational safeguards, including access controls, secret management, audit logs, and monitoring. No system is guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
